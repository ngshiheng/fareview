## Content

-   You may find the list of commercial beer prices under [`data/`](./data/) or on [this Google Sheets](https://s.jerrynsh.com/fareview)

## Development Setup

### Installation

Make sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed on your machine.

```sh
poetry install

# Installing dependencies only
poetry install --no-root

# Updating dependencies to their latest versions
poetry update
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Before you begin your development work, make sure you have installed [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#installation).

Some example useful invocations:

-   `pre-commit install`: Default invocation. Installs the pre-commit script alongside any existing git hooks.
-   `pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite`: Idempotently replaces existing git hook scripts with pre-commit, and also installs hook environments.

### Database

-   Make sure you have a running instance of the latest PostgreSQL in your local machine.

```sh
# Example to spin up a PostgreSQL Docker instance locally
docker run -d --name dpostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:latest
```

-   By default, the database for this project should be named as `fareview`.
-   For database migration steps, please read [this](alembic/README.md).
