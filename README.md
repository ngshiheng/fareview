## Development Setup

### Installation

Make sure you have [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) installed on your machine.

```sh
poetry install

# Installing dependencies only
poetry install --no-root

# Updating dependencies to their latest versions
poetry update
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Before you begin your development work, make sure you have installed [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/index.html#installation).

Some example useful invocations:

-   `pre-commit install`: Default invocation. Installs the pre-commit script alongside any existing git hooks.
-   `pre-commit install --install-hooks --overwrite`: Idempotently replaces existing git hook scripts with pre-commit, and also installs hook environments.

### Database

-   Make sure you have a running instance of the latest PostgreSQL in your local machine.

```sh
# Example to spin up a PostgreSQL Docker instance locally
docker run -d --name dpostgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_HOST_AUTH_METHOD=trust postgres:latest
```

-   By default, the database for this project should be named as `fareview`.
-   For database migration steps, please read [this](alembic/README.md).

## Usage

### Start crawling

#### Run single spider

```sh
# To list all spiders
poetry run scrapy crawl list

# To run a single spider
poetry run scrapy crawl shopee

# To run single spider with json output
poetry run scrapy crawl shopee -o shopee.json
```

#### Run all spiders

```sh
poetry run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 poetry run scrapy crawl

# Run on Heroku
heroku run scrapy list | xargs -n 1 heroku run scrapy crawl
```

#### Run all spiders, in parallel

```sh
scrapy list | xargs -n 1 -P 0 scrapy crawl
```

### Proxy & Sentry (optional)

[ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=jerryng) is used as our proxy server provider. [Sentry](https://sentry.io/) is used for error monitoring.

```sh
export SCRAPER_API_KEY="<YOUR_SCRAPER_API_KEY>"
export SENTRY_DSN="<YOUR_SENTRY_DSN>"
```
